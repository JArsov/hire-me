# Hire-me technical challenge

This project is created using create-react-app with Typescript and npm as a package manager.

## Project Setup
A minimal setup is required before using the application. Please complete the following steps:

### Set up environment variables
The application relies on an `.env` file in order to work correctly. In the project root there is a `.setup.env` file as an example. You can just rename this file to `.env` and everything should work as intended. ***\*Note\*: You may need to change the access token within the `.env` file***

### Install the dependencies
Before you start using the application, you need to install the dependencies. That can be achieved with the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Start the project
The project can be started by running:

```
npm start
```
